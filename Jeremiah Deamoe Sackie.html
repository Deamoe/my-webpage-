        <p> <em>
            When I was much younger, one of my dreams was to complete my tertiary education in the city. I grew up in a small,  beautiful rural community that was surrounded by farmland where I completed my secondary education. Due to my family's financial incapability, they struggled to pay for my tuition, including the tuition of my siblings. 
            <br><br>
            Upon completion of my secondary education in 2016, I started to strategize a befitting plan as to how to relocate to the city, considering my parents’ financial standings. Six months had elapsed, yet, I couldn’t find my way out. 
            <br><br>
            Therefore, I started to render my services as a teacher at an elementary school within my community. Through that, I was able to generate some cash that I used to transport myself in the city. 
            <br><br>
            The city is full of influential and positive-minded people that could be a great help to my journey. When I arrived in the city, I had no one to accommodate me. This was one of the most challenging moments I have faced in my life at a young age.
            <br><br>
            However, I was never deterred. Fortunately for me, a friend who I once helped to get admission during our junior year in 
            High School called me. We had a brief conversation. 
            <br><br>
            I explained my situation to him and he gave me his brother’s particulars. His brother offered me a one-bedroom that was in an unfinished building. He told me that I could stay as long as I wished. I was excited although the place wasn’t fancy. For years plus, I suffered to sustain myself and I had to endure the bites of mosquitoes every night. Many nights I went to bed with an empty stomach.
            <br><br>
            As time went by, I started to become accustomed to city life. I began to practise journalism. I was so thirsty for success that I used to sleep on the floor at a radio station (FARBRIC RADIO 101.1 FM) in order to use their internet service so that I could explore the internet for opportunities. 
            <br><br>
            Consequently, I was able to travel to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where I attended the Young African Thinkers Convention (YATC2018). I met inspiring and like-minded, positive-driven youth from across Africa. Upon my return, I got many opportunities that enabled me to live a much preferable life in the city. 
            <br><br>
            I have learned so many things from this experience; one of those is to be steadfast in pursuit of our goals. Today, I am the only person in my family to have reached this far, living in the city, and schooling in a techanical university "Starz College of Science and Technology", studying Bachelor of Information Technology(BIT).<br>
